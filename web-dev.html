				<h2>Finally found what I love to do! </h2>
			<h1>How it all started</h1>
			<p>I graduated with a major in Marketing but there was a time I wondered if I should go for the marketing industry after graduation. As a student I was lucky to get several part-time jobs in marketing agencies, and everyone told me that I was "fit", that I had prospect in the industry. However, when it came to the big question, "is this what you want to do for the rest of your life?," the answer was no. It's true that marketing interests me, but I was not really passionate about it.</p>
			<p>So when I was a senior in college I got a job in a French IT company, as I wanted to work in the tech industry and I speak French. Over there I was working on network system projects, which were pretty foreign to me. Learning about network was tricky, but at the end of the day I knew that I found something that inspired me.

			<h1>My very first attempts</h1>
			<ul>
			<li><p><a href="HTML-firstpage.html" target="_blank"><b>First assignment for "Introduction to HTML" course</b></a> on <a href="http://www.intro-webdesign.com/" target="_blank">Coursera</a> by Professor Colleen van Lent. I keep it as it is. Years later I will look back and see how far I'll have come.</p></li>
			<li><p><a href="First-styled-page.html" target="_blank"><b>The improved version of the assignment above.</b></a> First time trying CSS. I was thinking about making it look like a CV, but publishing your information online is not a very good idea. :D</p></li>
			<li><p><a href="HTMLCSS-assignment-datingweb.html" target="_blank"><b>Week 1 assignment for the "HTML, CSS and JavaScript" course</b></a> on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript/home/welcome" target="_blank">Coursera</a> by Professor David Rossiter.</p></li>
			<li><p><a href="index.html"><b>... And this github page!</b></a> I'm still learning and still working on it. Let's go back sometime and see how it will become. :D</p></li>
			<p>Also, you can find some of my recent code on <a href="https://codepen.io/tnp1606" target="_blank"><b>CodePen</b></a>.
			<marquee><p>Code is fun! :)</marquee>
