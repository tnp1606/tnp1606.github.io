				<h2>So, I've learned to code (finally!) </h2>
			<p>I started to learn about web design in late September. It's been merely 5 weeks but I've already fall in love with it!</p>
			<p>What I find much more entertaining is that it's not just how you play with coding, it's about designing, arranging and make them look visually attractive together. It's such a great feeling to see how your codes turn into something nice - and it can be nicer. :)
